Once upon a time, three fishes lived in a pond. They were very close friends. The first fish was very wise; the second fish was intelligent and witty, while the third fish was very lazy and believed in fate. One day, the first fish overheard a conversation between two fishermen about casting their net the next day. He quickly returned and informed both of his friends. The first fish chose to leave the pond and go to a nearby lake. The second fish stayed and decided to find a way, and the third fish continued to believe in fate and did nothing.

The second and the third fishes were caught in the fishermen’s net the next day. The second fish used his brains and remained still. When the fishermen saw him still, they assumed he was dead and threw him back into the pond.

               The Fisherman
               The tiny Fish
               <br> Fish Story For Children
             <br><H3>Let’s read the “Clever Fish” STORY</H3> 
               
               
               
               Once upon a time, a fisherman was fishing in a river, as usual. He threw his net into the river and just sat there waiting for the fish to get trapped so that he could sell the fish in the market and get some good money from it.
               
               Fish & Fisherman
               After some time, the fisherman felt some rustle- bustle in the net. Thinking that he must have caught a lot of fish in the net, he took the net out of the water. But there was only one tiny little fish in that net. He grabbed hold of that fish, and all of a sudden, the fish started talking. The tiny little fish said to the fisherman, “Oh fisherman, please leave me, please leave me, otherwise, I will die, I will die without water.”
               
               But the fisherman did not give any attention to the request of the fish. The tiny little fish again said to the fisherman, “Oh fisherman, I will tell you something which is of your help. If you let me back into the water, I will tell all my friends about you, and I’ll bring them near to the bank of the river for you to have more fish.
               
               The fisherman thought to himself, “That’s not a bad deal to let go of one tiny little fish today, as tomorrow I will get a lot more fish.”
               
               
               Believing the word of this tiny fish, the fisherman let go of her into the water again. The tiny little fish was happy and never came back near the river bank.
               
               Fish
               The poor fisherman came to the river bank the next day expecting that there would be a lot of fish that the tiny little fish would bring to him. But that tiny little fish was clever enough to save her own life and that of her friends, as she asked them not to go near the river bank.
               
       
               
               <h3>Story Summary</h3>

She promises the fishermen to bring back more of her fish friends near the river bank the next day. Believing the tiny little fish, the fisherman let go of her into the water and started waiting for the next day to arrive.
